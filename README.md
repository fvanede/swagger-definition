# swagger-definition
Swagger definition as YAML and JSON format for HC REST web services:
* Leaderboard web service (tournaments and ranking of players)
* Registration service, including operations to return player information, jackpot values, player preferences etc.

Used bootprint-swagger to pretty print the JSON definition file and placed it in the documentation subdirectory. See http://www.npmjs.com/package/bootprint-swagger for more information.
